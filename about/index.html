  <h1>About me</h1>


  <h2>Technology</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve been studying technology since 2011, and I’m specialized in computer networks, servers, wireless and web/mobile programming.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I did an scholarship program at the University of Toronto, Canadá, and took some courses in the Computer Science major, besides an academic writing course, focusing on scientific articles production.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m an undergraduate student at the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil under the major of Technology in Computer Networks.
    <br>
    Most of the knowledge I acquired through those years was self-taught, researching on the internet, practicing tutorials, chatting with friends, and hands on trying, failing and trying again.
  </p>
  

  <h2>Writing </h2>
  <p>
    I started writing two years ago on a notebook and also on a personal blog, called mundodeotavio.ml, which has texts in english and portuguese with purpose of sharing my ideas, thought and observations about my favorite topics, allowing myself to have full text-creation freedom.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m an assiduous reader and I’m always trying to keep myself actualized on the innovations on subjects I love and have great importance to me, such as good life, career, self-development, entrepreneurship, music, philosophy, culinary and biographies.
    <br>
    I like to watch great movies, TV shows, YouTube channels and documentaries on the most diverse topics to enrich my repertoire of knowledge and opinion and really appreciate the filmmaking art.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another old passion of mine is the music. I’ve been floating around the most diverse genres and types of music since I was a kid, and I love finding something new, that really catches me and draws my attention and curiosity. Because of that love for music, I taught myself how to play guitar; Thenceforth, sometimes I attempt to compose songs and arrange them, but just as an amateur — They don’t usually come as nice as I expected :(
  </p>


  <p>
    I practice meditation, yoga, Muay Thai and bike around a lot.
    <br>
    People usually say that I have a tremendous ease in learning and absorbing new things, and I feel pretty confident to talk or write on any topic.
  </p>


  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I started working at the age of 16 as an office assistant at the Northeast Bank of Brazil (Banco do Nordeste do Brasil) in Fortaleza, CE.
    <br>
    From them on I’ve developed a enormous ability and ease with text editing and spreadsheet tools, being able to handle huge chunks of data, formulas and macros.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’ve also worked as an assistant for Itau-Fiat bank, in a car dealership called Icavel, where I was dealing directly with the customer service, helping them to choose the best offers and taxes for their financing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently I’ve been working as autonomous IT technician for an outsourcing company, helping government agencies and participating in a startup project called Autoboot, which aims to deliver services and consulting for business in our geographical bounds. We want to offer a complete assistance on technology management to these business, helping them building and evolving their websites, apps, visual identity, marketing strategies, social networks, technological innovations and IT management.
