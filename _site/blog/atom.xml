			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quoted from the book Business Model You by Alexander Osterwalder, Tim Clark, and Yves Pigneur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The company I started did research and market entry consulting for companies wanting to enter Asian markets, particularly Japan. After more than six years of ferociously hard work, we received a multi-million-dollar buyout offer. This was all new to me; when I started, I didn’t even know people sold companies.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I paid off three mortgages, maxed out the kids’ college funds, took the family on a great vacation, and invested the remainder to provide passive income. But like everyone else, I still faced the big question: What am I going to do with the rest of my life?
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a way, that question grew tougher precisely because I’d been relieved of the pressing need to earn a living. Seeking answers sharpened my awareness that work is about more than achieving financial independence.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I think most successful entrepreneurs feel the same way. I’ve talked with a lot of people who collectively have sold dozens of companies for amounts ranging from one to $40 million U.S. Not a single one ever mentioned “achieving financial independence” as their primary motivation for working.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fortune-seekers can rarely sustain their passion through the hard times. Successful enterprises are laser-focused on Value Provided to Customers. Entrepreneurship is not about you; it’s about effectively serving others.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 — Carl James, Entrepreneur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This testimony hit me like a rock!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not about you, it’s all about serving others. Providing great service to other people. Giving value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking money or financial freedom, you’ll never gonna get it! It’s a endless road to dissatisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the one thing that you do with pleasure, even when times are harsh, and do it for the people, with passion and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the rest comes with time.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
